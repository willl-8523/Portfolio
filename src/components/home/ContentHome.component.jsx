          How It All Started
        </h3>
        <p className="description-content-home max-w-75 w-3/4 my-7 px-2 text-very-dark-gray">
          It all started in 2013 when a good friend introduced me to web
          development. <br />
          <br /> We began learning HTML on the{' '}
          <span className="text-link">siteDuZero</span>, which later became
          <Link
            to="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/"
            target="_blank"

            {' '}
            Openclassroom.
          </Link>
          Shortly after, I delved into CSS, and I was amazed by its power at
          that moment!
          <br />
          <br /> I started learning jQuery to improve my skills, but after a
          while, I realized that jQuery is built on top of JavaScript. So, I
          dropped it and began learning Vanilla JS. Once I felt I understood
          what was happening under the hood, I chose ReactJS to empower my
          frontend skills for the long term.
          <br />
          <br />I also added NodeJS, PHP, Symfony and NextJS to my skill
          set, enabling me to provide Full-Stack JavaScript services ðŸ˜€.
